      As easy to make as chocolate chip cookies, these scones are a delicious
      treat with your morning coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can find many variations of this simple recipe using buttermilk, heavy
      cream, or butter. My favorite chocolate chip scones are made using butter.
      The texture is between a biscuit and a muffin. Light, flaky, and oh so
      tasty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using triple chocolate chips is heavenly. If you are feeling adventurous,
      you can add your favorite fruit to the scone dough too.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 1/4 cups all purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/3 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>3 tsp baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup cold butter (cut into small cubes)</li>
      <li>1 cup chocolate chips</li>
      <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 400F.</li>
      <li>
        Place flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Whisk them
        together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add cold butter and cut it into the dry ingredients until crumbly
        consistency.
      </li>
      <li>Add the chocolate chips</li>
      <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the egg into the milk.</li>
      <li>Pour mixture into the dry ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Mix together with your hands or a spatula until combined. Do not
        over-mix.
      </li>
      <li>Spread a bit of flour on flat work surface.</li>
      <li>
        Place batter on floured work surface and pat down into an 8 inch disk.
      </li>
      <li>Cut into 8 equal wedges.</li>
      <li>Place wedges on baking sheet.</li>
      <li>Bake for 16-18 minutes, or until just starting to brown on top.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      These scones are delicious right out of the oven, or served at room
      temperature. If you don't want to bake all 8 scones at once, the dough can
      be frozen to bake at a later time. Just pop the frozen scones in the oven
      and bake for an extra 10 minutes.

    <p>Desserts with contrasting patterns of dark and light parts became popular at the 
      beginning of the 19th century. Half-moon cookies, also called black-and-white cookies
      or half-and-half cookies, are frosted on one half with vanilla and one half with chocolate.
    </p>
    <p>Half-moon cookies are made slightly different based on the region. New York City versions
      are flat with a dense cake base and a royal icing. Central New York and Boston versions tend to 
      be dome shaped with a fluffy cake base and frosting. Some black-and-white versions use
      fondant instead of icing or frosting.
